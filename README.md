# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction
Predicting passenger satisfaction using KNN, Random Forest and MLP

In some parts of the world, passenger feedback plays a vital role in helping airlines and travel service providers improve their services. ðŸ›« In this project, we aim to develop a model that predicts passengers' overall sentimentâ€”whether they are satisfied or dissatisfiedâ€”with the services provided by airlines.

This dataset also offers a great opportunity for data enthusiasts to explore further analysis and visualization, gaining valuable insights from the data. Whether you're interested in machine learning or data analysis, this project provides a versatile playground for enhancing your skills.
